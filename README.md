Adivina el Vocabulario Espacial is a Spanish language, single-player word guessing game designed for primary school children. The game's objective is to guess the correct space-themed word by selecting a letter from the button options. The moon will complete one of its lunar phases for every incorrect word the player chooses. The player wins if they can guess the word without allowing the moon to complete all of its phases; the player loses if the moon reaches its final lunar stage. I dedicate this game to Ms. Esparza's English and Spanish language immersion class.
